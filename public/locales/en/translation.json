    "home_description": "ONDA Life is a practice of self-awareness and body awareness.\n\nConnect your tracker or smartwatch in settings and observe how your vital signs change during practice in real time.\n\nThe greater your success in completing practices — your time in practice and improvement in your state — the more OND in your account. A connected tracker or smartwatch will also increase your earnings for completing practices.\n\nWhen all practices of a part are completed with more than 40% success, you unlock the next level.\n\nAnd remember that the ONDA level system is a long chain of realizations through feeling yourself as an amoeba, fish, animal, primate, human, brain cell, DNA, and finally, an atom. But if you give due attention to each stage, your journey will be easy and fulfilling.\n\nAt the beginning of each part before practices you will see general guidance. At the end of each part – more detailed attunement to the current state of practices.\n\nGood luck on your journey!",
